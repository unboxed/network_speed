== Network Speed

This is a tool developed during one of Unboxed's hackathon sessions. It can be used to measure the internet speed on your router. If you have multiple routers in the office, this can plot them on a chart and show you which one is the fastest.

It can also be configured to measure the internet speed of each individual computer in the office.

In order to get data for this you have to install the Network Speed Daemon gem: 

    https://github.com/unboxed/network_speed_daemon

The gem will run a script every 3 minutes which will send data back to this API.

Once enough data has been added you can view the result by starting the server: 
    rails s

If you want to stop using it, remember to uninstall the network_speed_daemon gem so that it does not continue firing a speed test every 3 minutes.
